Two of the most effective approaches are quantization and pruning, which can significantly reduce model size, memory usage, and inference time while maintaining acceptable performance.\n\n### Why Model Compression Matters\n\nModel compression addresses several critical challenges in deep learning deployment:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## Key Benefits of Model Compression\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory footprint enables deployment on mobile devices and edge hardware\n- **Inference Speed**: Faster computations through reduced precision arithmetic and fewer operations\n- **Energy Consumption**: Lower power requirements for battery-powered devices\n- **Cost Reduction**: Decreased cloud computing costs and hardware requirements\n- **Accessibility**: Enables AI deployment in environments with limited computational resources\n:::\n\n## Quantization\n\nQuantization reduces the precision of model weights and activations from floating-point representations (typically 32-bit) to lower-bit representations (8-bit, 4-bit, or even binary).\n\n### Fundamentals of Quantization\n\n#### Uniform Quantization\n\nThe most common form maps continuous values to a finite set of discrete levels:\n\n$$Q(x) = \\text{round}\\left(\\frac{x - \\text{zero\\_point}}{\\text{scale}}\\right) + \\text{zero\\_point}$$ {#eq-quantization}\n\nWhere:\n\n- `scale`: The step size between quantization levels\n- `zero_point`: The value that maps to zero in the quantized representation\n\n#### Asymmetric vs Symmetric Quantization\n\n**Symmetric Quantization**: Zero point is at the center of the range\n\n- Simpler implementation\n- Better for weights that are roughly centered around zero\n- Formula: $Q(x) = \\text{round}(x / \\text{scale})$\n\n**Asymmetric Quantization**: Zero point can be anywhere in the range\n\n- Better utilization of the quantization range\n- More suitable for activations (often non-negative)\n- Handles skewed distributions better\n\n### Types of Quantization\n\n#### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)\n\nQuantizes a pre-trained model without retraining:\n\n**Static PTQ**: Uses a calibration dataset to determine quantization parameters\n\n- Faster deployment\n- No training data required\n- May have accuracy degradation for complex models\n\n**Dynamic PTQ**: Determines quantization parameters at runtime\n\n- Better accuracy than static PTQ\n- Slightly higher inference overhead\n- No calibration dataset needed\n\n#### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\n\nSimulates quantization effects during training:\n\n- Higher accuracy preservation\n- Requires retraining the model\n- Longer development time but better results\n\n### Bit-width Considerations\n\n| Bit-width | Compression | Accuracy Trade-off | Use Case |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------|\n| 8-bit (INT8) | 2-4x | Minimal | Most common, well-supported |\n| 4-bit | Up to 8x | Moderate | Inference-only scenarios |\n| Binary/Ternary | Up to 32x | Significant | Extreme compression needs |\n\n: Quantization bit-width comparison {#tbl-bitwidth}\n\n### Mixed-Precision Quantization\n\nDifferent layers use different precisions based on sensitivity analysis:\n\n- Critical layers (e.g., first and last layers) kept at higher precision\n- Less sensitive layers quantized more aggressively\n- Automated search algorithms determine optimal bit allocation\n\n## Pruning\n\nPruning removes redundant or less important connections, neurons, or entire layers from neural networks.\n\n### Types of Pruning\n\n#### Magnitude-Based Pruning\n\nRemoves weights with the smallest absolute values:\n\n- Simple to implement\n- Works well for many architectures\n- May not capture weight importance accurately\n\n#### Gradient-Based Pruning\n\nConsiders gradients to determine weight importance:\n\n- **Fisher Information**: Uses second-order derivatives\n- **SNIP** (Single-shot Network Pruning): Prunes before training\n- **GraSP**: Gradient Signal Preservation\n\n#### Lottery Ticket Hypothesis\n\nIdentifies sparse subnetworks that can be trained from scratch:\n\n- Iterative magnitude pruning\n- Rewinding to early training checkpoints\n- Maintains original network performance\n\n### Pruning Granularities\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Unstructured Pruning\n\nRemoves individual weights regardless of their position:\n\n- Higher compression ratios possible\n- Irregular sparsity patterns\n- May not lead to actual speedup without specialized hardware\n\n## Structured Pruning\n\nRemoves entire structures (channels, filters, layers):\n\n- **Channel Pruning**: Removes entire feature map channels\n- **Filter Pruning**: Removes convolutional filters\n- **Block Pruning**: Removes structured weight blocks\n\nBenefits:\n- Guaranteed speedup on standard hardware\n- Maintains regular computation patterns\n- Easier to implement in existing frameworks\n\n## Semi-Structured Pruning\n\nBalances compression and hardware efficiency:\n\n- N:M sparsity (e.g., 2:4 sparsity removes 2 out of every 4 weights)\n- Supported by modern hardware (NVIDIA Ampere architecture)\n- Good compression with hardware acceleration\n\n:::\n\n### Pruning Schedules\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| eval: false\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Start Training] --> B{Pruning Strategy}\n    B -->|One-Shot| C[Remove All Weights at
