Named after mathematicians Andrey Kolmogorov and Vladimir Arnold, these networks are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which provides a mathematical foundation for representing multivariate continuous functions.\n\nUnlike traditional neural networks that place fixed activation functions at nodes (neurons), KANs place learnable activation functions on edges (weights). This fundamental architectural change offers several advantages, including better interpretability, higher accuracy with fewer parameters, and improved generalization capabilities.\n\n## Mathematical Foundation: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, proven in 1957, states that every multivariate continuous function can be represented as a composition and superposition of continuous functions of a single variable. Mathematically, for any continuous function $f: [0,1]^n \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$\n, there exist continuous functions $\\phi_{q,p}: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n\n$$\nf(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = \\sum_{q=0}^{2n} \\Phi_q\\left( \\sum_{p=1}^{n} \\phi_{q,p}(x_p) \\right)\n$$\n\n\nThis theorem provides the theoretical foundation for KANs, suggesting that complex multivariate functions can be decomposed into simpler univariate functions arranged in a specific hierarchical structure.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Traditional MLPs vs KANs\n\n**Traditional MLPs:**\n- Fixed activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) at nodes\n- Linear transformations on edges (weights and biases)\n- Learning occurs through weight optimization\n- Limited interpretability due to distributed representations\n\n**Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks:**\n- Learnable activation functions on edges\n- No traditional linear weights\n- Each edge contains a univariate function (typically B-splines)\n- Nodes perform simple summation operations\n- Enhanced interpretability through edge function visualization\n\n### KAN Layer Structure\n\nA single KAN layer transforms an input vector of dimension `n_in` to an output vector of dimension `n_out`. Each connection between input and output nodes contains a learnable univariate function, typically parameterized using B-splines.\n\nThe transformation can be expressed as:\n$$\ny_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\\text{in}}} \\phi_{i,j}(x_i)\n$$\n\n\nWhere $\\phi_{i,j}$ represents the learnable function on the edge connecting input i to output j.\n\n## Key Components and Implementation\n\n### B-Spline Parameterization\n\nKANs typically use B-splines to parameterize the learnable functions on edges. B-splines offer several advantages:\n\n- **Smoothness**: Provide continuous derivatives up to a specified order\n- **Local Support**: Changes in one region don't affect distant regions\n- **Flexibility**: Can approximate a wide variety of functions\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Enable efficient computation and differentiation\n\n### Grid Structure\n\nThe B-splines are defined over a grid of control points. Key parameters include:\n\n- **Grid Size**: Number of intervals in the spline grid\n- **Spline Order**: Determines smoothness (typically cubic, k=3)\n- **Grid Range**: Input domain coverage for the splines\n\n### Residual Connections\n\nModern KAN implementations often include residual connections to improve training stability and enable deeper networks. These connections add a linear component to each edge function:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{i,j}(x) = \\text{spline\\_function}(x) + \\text{linear\\_function}(x)\n$$\n\n\n## Training Process\n\n### Forward Pass\n\n1. **Input Processing**: Input features are fed to the first layer\n2. **Edge Function Evaluation**: Each edge computes its learnable function\n3. **Node Summation**: Output nodes sum contributions from all incoming edges\n4. **Layer Propagation**: Process repeats through subsequent layers\n\n### Backward Pass\n\nTraining KANs requires computing gradients with respect to:\n- **Spline Coefficients**: Control points of B-spline functions\n- **Grid Points**: Locations of spline knots (in adaptive variants)\n- **Scaling Parameters**: Normalization factors for
