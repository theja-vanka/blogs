# Vision Transformers (ViT): A Simple Guide
![](vit.png)

## Introduction

Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a paradigm shift in computer vision, adapting the transformer architecture that revolutionized natural language processing for image classification and other visual tasks. Instead of relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ViTs treat images as sequences of patches, applying the self-attention mechanism to understand spatial relationships and visual features.

## Background: From CNNs to Transformers

Traditional computer vision relied heavily on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which process images through layers of convolutions that detect local features like edges, textures, and patterns. While effective, CNNs have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies across an image due to their local receptive fields.

Transformers, originally designed for language tasks, excel at modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. The key insight behind Vision Transformers was asking: "What if we could apply this powerful attention mechanism to images?"

::: {.callout-note}
## Key Insight
The fundamental breakthrough of ViTs was recognizing that images could be treated as sequences of patches, making them compatible with transformer architectures originally designed for text.
:::

## Core Concept: Images as Sequences

The fundamental innovation of ViTs lies in treating images as sequences of patches rather than pixel grids. Here's how this transformation works:

### Image Patch Embedding 

1. **Patch Division**: An input image (typically 224×224 pixels) is divided into fixed-size patches (commonly 16×16 pixels), resulting in a sequence of patches
2. **Linear Projection**: Each patch is flattened into a vector and linearly projected to create patch embeddings
3. **Position Encoding**: Since transformers don't inherently understand spatial relationships, positional encodings are added to maintain spatial information
4. **Classification Token**: A special learnable [CLS] token is prepended to the sequence, similar to BERT's approach

    A[Input Image 224×224] --> B[Divide into 16×16 patches]
    B --> C[196 patches]
    C --> D[Flatten each patch]
    D --> E[Linear projection]
    E --> F[Add positional encoding]
    F --> G[Prepend CLS token]
    G --> H[Sequence ready for transformer]
```

### Mathematical Formulation

For an image of size $H \times W \times C$ divided into patches of size $P \times P$:

- Number of patches: $N = \frac{H \times W}{P^2}$
- Each patch becomes a vector of size $P^2 \times C$
- After linear projection: embedding dimension $D$

::: {.callout-tip}
## Patch Size Trade-off
Smaller patches (e.g., 8×8) provide finer detail but increase computational cost, while larger patches (e.g., 32×32) are more efficient but may lose important spatial information.
:::

## Architecture Components 

### Patch Embedding Layer

The patch embedding layer converts image patches into token embeddings that the transformer can process. This involves:

- Reshaping patches into vectors
- Linear transformation to desired embedding dimension
- Adding positional encodings

### Transformer Encoder 

The core of ViT consists of standard transformer encoder blocks, each containing:

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA)**: Allows patches to attend to all other patches
- **Layer Normalization**: Applied before both attention and MLP layers
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: Two-layer feedforward network with GELU activation
- **Residual Connections**: Skip connections around both attention and MLP blocks

```{mermaid}

    A[Input Patches] --> B[Patch Embedding]
    B --> C[Add Position Encoding]
    C --> D[Add CLS Token]
    D --> E[Transformer Encoder Block 1]
    E --> F[Transformer Encoder Block 2]
    F --> G[...]
    G --> H[Transformer Encoder Block N]
    H --> I[Extract CLS Token]
    I --> J[Classification Head]
    J --> K[Output Predictions]
```

### Classification Head 

The final component extracts the [CLS] token's representation and passes it through:

- Layer normalization
- Linear classifier to produce class predictions

## Self-Attention in Vision 

The self-attention mechanism in ViTs operates differently from CNNs:

### Attention Maps

- Each patch can attend to every other patch in the image
- Attention weights reveal which parts of the image are most relevant for classification
- This enables modeling of long-range spatial dependencies

::: {.callout-important}
## Global Receptive Field
Unlike CNNs that build up receptive fields gradually, ViTs have global receptive fields from the first layer, allowing immediate access to information across the entire image.
:::

### Global Context

The ability to model global context from the first layer is a key advantage of ViTs over traditional CNNs.

## Training Considerations

### Data Requirements

Vision Transformers typically require large amounts of training data to perform well:

- **Pre-training**: Often trained on large datasets like ImageNet-21k or JFT-300M
- **Fine-tuning**: Then adapted to specific tasks with smaller datasets
- **Data Efficiency**: ViTs can be less data-efficient than CNNs when training from scratch

### Optimization Challenges

- **Initialization**: Careful weight initialization is crucial
- **Learning Rate**: Often requires different learning rates for different components
- **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout and weight decay are important
- **Warmup**: Learning rate warmup is commonly used

::: {.callout-warning}
## Training from Scratch
Training ViTs from scratch on small datasets often leads to poor performance. Pre-training on large datasets followed by fine-tuning is the recommended approach.
