Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Krishnatheja Vanka \

Machine Learning Engineer (Applied Computer Vision)

Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on computer vision, generative AI, and deep learning. I specialize in building and deploying end-to-end ML solutionsâ€”from data curation and model training to real-world deployment using PyTorch, AWS, and modern MLOps tools. Currently at Lytx, I work on visual models for challenging driving conditions and fatigue detection. Previously built intelligent vision systems in manufacturing and healthcare domains. Active open-source contributor (PyTorch Lightning, TorchMetrics) and community mentor in AI/ML spaces.
